OpenCV Tutorial: A Guide to Learn OpenCV

This OpenCV tutorial is for beginners just getting started learning the basics. Inside this guide, you’ll learn basic image processing operations using the OpenCV library using Python.

And by the end of the tutorial you’ll be putting together a complete project to count basic objects in images using contours.

While this tutorial is aimed at beginners just getting started with image processing and the OpenCV library, I encourage you to give it a read even if you have a bit of experience.

A quick refresher in OpenCV basics will help you with your own projects as well.
